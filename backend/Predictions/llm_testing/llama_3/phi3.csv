(Note: This is a hypothetical analysis based on the given headlines and their sentiment implications.)

1. ""Under the deal, Lupin can receive a potential total consideration of up to $84 million based on future contingent milestones,"" presents positive sentiments due to financial gains but with some uncertainty attached because it is dependent on achieving certain goals in time and conditions being met (contingent). Therefore: +0.3

2. ""Stocks including HCL Tech, IREDA, Jio Financial, RVNL, HDFC Life, DMart, Lupin, Zomato and more may remain under spotlight before the opening bell on Monday, July 15.,"" is neutral because it only mentions that these companies might be in focus without providing any sentiment or impact information. Therefore: +0

3. ""Lupin sells US women's health business to Evofem Biosciences for up to $84 million,"" presents mixed feelings as the company makes a significant sale, which is positive but also loses part of its assets and might imply dependency on other units or diversification strategy (which could be seen negatively by some investors). Therefore: -0.3

Summing these sentiment scores gives us Net Sentiment Score for Lupin Company as follows: 0.3 + 0 - 0.3 = +0"
