2. ""From the Sensex pack, SBI, NTPC, and UltraTech Cement were the top gainers, rising 2-2.5%."" - Positive (0.6) as it indicates that UltraTech Cement was one of the top performing stocks in the Sensex, with a gain of 2-2.5%.

3. ""Wholesale price inflation, ECB interest rate decision and Q1 results of RIL, Infosys, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement, Wipro are the key events, data points to track"" - Neutral (0) as it doesn't provide any sentiment about the company's performance.

Here's how I calculated it:
- Key events: 0 (neutral)
- Among the top gainers: 1 for Bajaj Auto (since it is a positive mention), -1 for ONGC, Shriram Finance, SBI Life Insurance, and SBI (since they are mentioned as gainers but not Asian Paints), so net 0 for this part.
