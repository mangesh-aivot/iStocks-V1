4,"Dividend yielding stocks: In a raging bull market don't ignore, it serves more than one purpose. 5 stocks with dividend yield between 4 to 7 %","In a market which is giving decent capital gains, looking at dividend yield stocks might not appeal to many. But when valuations are high and stocks which are IBC cases, quoting at half a billion market capitalization, then probably if one is looking at putting in fresh capital, it might be better to be cautious and don't ignore stocks where there is a cushion of dividend yield. There is reason to believe that if bears come to rule the street then dividend yield does act as cushion and even end up protecting capital. But then there are some things to be looked at before deciding to have dividend yield as a theme to invest. Track record of paying dividends on a regular basis for a decade or not. Yes, it might have missed one time in ten years, but the fact that if a company is paying a dividend continuously for ten years, it gives a reasonable level of comfort that it will continue to do so.",2024-07-21

Then as the time went, stocks like Bajaj Auto and Hero honda also joined the re-rating bandwagon. But the re-rating of the auto ancillary industry has been slower, for a valid reason. These auto ancillary units are dependent on their main buyers. So, for an auto ancillary company which has been supplying to the TVS motors, Tata motors the process of transformation started a long time back but for some others, where the major buyer which is the auto companies was late in coming out with the EV model, transition has been slower. But the biggest factor which distinguishes a winner and laggard in the auto ancillary industry is how proactive the management has been of auto ancillary companies in anticipating the demand and changing its priority.

8,"An unnoticed trend: Industrial houses getting re-rated. After Tata and Mahindra, are Aditya Birla Group stocks next in line?","In the last four years, beside different sectors getting rerated there has been another sort of  re-rating which has been going on the street. Re-rating which is based on the ownership of that set of companies or is commonly known as the industrial houses. In most cases, this has been happening post some kind of restructuring which has been done at group levels. Whether it is demerging, takeover or re-focussing some of the business into additional areas. Now some of the old industrial houses have one big strength, a number of them have real estate assets which can be monetized so they don't have to rush to the capital market or take additional debt when they are re- focusing their priorities.
